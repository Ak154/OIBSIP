    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p>
        There is a great deal of talk and endeavour to 
        protect nature, the animals, the birds, the whales 
        and dolphins, to clean the polluted rivers, lakes,
        fields and so on. Nature is not put together by 
        thought, as religion and belief are. Nature is the 
        tiger, that extraordinary animal with its energy, 
        its great sense of power. Nature is the solitary 
        tree in the field, the meadows and the grove; it 
        is that squirrel shyly hiding behind a bough. Nature 
        is the ant, the bee and all the living things of 
        the earth. Nature is the river, not a particular 
        river, whether the Ganga, the Thames or the Mississippi.
        Nature is those mountains, snow-clad, with dark blue 
        valleys and range of hills meeting the sea. The universe 
        is part of nature. One must have a feeling for all this, 
        not destroy it, not kill for one's pleasure or one's 
        table. We do kill cabbages, the vegetables we eat, 
        but one must draw the line somewhere. If you do not eat 
        vegetables, how will you live? So one must intelligently
        discern.
        <br> <br>

        Nature is part of our life. We grew out of the seed, 
        the earth, and we are part of all that, but we are rapidly
        losing the sense that we are animals like the others. Can 
        you have a feeling for a tree, look at it, see the beauty 
        of it, listen to the sound it makes? Can you be sensitive 
        to the little plant, a little weed, to that creeper growing 
        up the wall, to the light on the leaves and the many shadows? 
        One must be aware of all this and have that sense of communion
        with nature around you. You may live in a town, but you do 
        have trees here and there. A flower in the next garden may be 
        ill-kept, crowded with weeds, but look at it, feel that you 
        are part of all that, part of all living things. If you hurt 
        nature, you are hurting yourself.
        <br> <br>

        One knows all this has been said before in different ways, 
        but we don't seem to pay much attention. Is it that we are 
        so caught up in our own network of problems, our desires, our 
        urges of pleasure and pain that we never look around, never 
        watch the moon? Watch it. Watch with all your eyes and ears, 
        your sense of smell. Watch. Look as though you are looking for 
        the first time. If you can do that, you see for the first time 
        that tree, bush or blade of grass. Then you can see your teacher, 
        your mother or father, your brother or sister, for the first time. 
        There is an extraordinary feeling about that: the wonder, the 
        strangeness, the miracle of a fresh morning that has never been 
        before and never will be.
        <br><br>

        Be in communion with nature, not verbally caught in the description
        of it, but be a part of it, be aware, feel that you belong to all 
        that, be able to have love for all that, to admire a deer, the 
        lizard on the wall, that broken branch lying on the ground. Look at
        the evening star or the new moon without the word, without merely 
        saying how beautiful it is and turning your back on it, attracted 
        by something else, but watch that single star and new delicate moon 
        as though for the first time. If there is such communion between you 
        and nature, you can commune with man, with the boy sitting next to you,
        with your educator or with your parents. We have lost all sense of 
        relationship in which there is not only a verbal statement of affection 
        and concern but also this sense of communion, which is not verbal. 
        It is a sense that we are all together, that we are all human beings, 
        not divided, not broken up, not belonging to any group or race or 
        some idealistic concepts, but that we are all human beings, living on 
        this extraordinary, beautiful earth.
