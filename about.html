        <h2>About Nature</h2>
        <p>
            Nature is made of everthing we see around us 
            tree, flowers, plants, animals, sky, mountain,
            forest and more. Human beings depend on nature
            to stay alive. Nature helps us breath, gives 
            us food, water, shelter, medicine, and cloths.
            We find many colors in nature which make the
            Earth beautiful.
            <br><br>

            Everything we see around us, right from the 
            moment we step outside our home is part of 
            nature. The trees, animals, landscape, flowers, 
            trees, breeze, sunlight, everything that makes 
            our surroundings so beautiful and mesmerizing
            are part of nature. Nature does not arise 
            spontaneously but needs years and years to bloom 
            and blossom.
            <br><br>

            According to researchers, nature we see today 
            has developed in 4.5 billion years. Initially, 
            the earth was not sustainable for any kind of 
            living thing. The atmosphere had no to very little
            oxygen, and the same was the case with water.
            The land made of molten magma and the atmosphere 
            was toxic to survive. Slowly, the earth cooled down,
            and life started blooming on it. It began to rain, 
            and nature, as we see today, was formed. This nature
            then gifted the earth with living creatures like 
            animals, birds, and finally, humans.
            <br><br>

            It is the Mother Nature who never harms us but 
            always nurtures us. By providing us fruits and 
            vegetables, it nurtures our body. By providing us 
            water hydrates our body, and by providing oxygen, 
            it cleanses our body. It is usually seen that people 
            who live close to nature, especially the villagers 
            live a somewhat happy life as compared to the people 
            living amidst the high hovering skyscrapers. Nature 
            provides our ears sweet sound of birds, rejuvenates 
            us with fresh air, breeze fills our soul with joy, 
            and inspires to flow like the river. Nature provides 
            the raw material for economic development as well.
            <br> <br>

            Nature has inspired not only poets and writers but 
            also the common man. All the great poets and writers
            like William Wordsworth have always given the nature 
            a significant space in their writings and musings. 
            Nature has the power to take us to the place of peace
            and imagination to free the emotions that been locked 
            inside us. If those emotions and feelings get freed, 
            then there is immense power in them to bring on the 
            changes that are unexpected. Many people are currently 
            working and getting linked with the nature conservation 
            organizations to preserve and enhance the nature and 
            beauty around us.
            <br> <br>

            Nature is the life support of all the living things. 
            Nature provides our ears sweet sound of birds, rejuvenates 
            us with fresh air, breeze fills our soul with joy, and 
            inspires to flow like the river. Nature also provides the 
            raw material for economic development. Imbalance in nature 
            can lead to global warming, earthquakes, floods, and 
            drastic climate changes.
