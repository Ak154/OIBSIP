    <h2>Our Services</h2>
    <p>
        The world's forest ecosystems provide critical 
        and diverse services and values to human society. 
        As primary habitat for a wide range of species, 
        forests support biodiversity maintenance and 
        conservation. Forest growth sequesters and stores
        carbon from the atmosphere, contributing to 
        regulation of the global carbon cycle and climate
        change mitigation. Healthy forest ecosystems 
        produce and conserve soil and stabilize stream 
        flows and water runoff—preventing land degradation 
        and desertification, and reducing the risks of 
        natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and 
        landslides. Forests also serve as sites of aesthetic,
        recreational, and spiritual value in many cultural 
        and societal contexts, and contribute to poverty 
        eradication and economic development by providing 
        food, fiber, timber, and other forest products 
        for subsistence and income generation.
        <br> <br>

        Yet continuing forest loss worldwide negatively 
        impacts the livelihoods of millions of people and 
        poses major challenges to sustainable development, 
        in part because these forest ecosystem services 
        continue to be undervalued, or not valued at all. 
        Fortunately, the global community appears to be 
        arriving at an important turning point, with a number 
        of recent developments pointing to a positive trajectory 
        of progress—including various commitments and agreements 
        made in recent years such as the New York Declaration on 
        Forests (NYDF), the Paris Agreement, the 2030 Agenda for 
        Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development 
        Goals (SDGs), and the UN Strategic Plan for Forests 
        2017-2030 (UNSPF) and its Global Forest Goals (GFGs).
        <br> <br>
        
        Partly in response to these global policy signals and 
        developments, governments are beginning to integrate 
        consideration of forest ecosystem services into their 
        development policies and plans. However,these efforts 
        are just beginning and much progress is yet to be made. 
        At the same time, investments in forest conservation 
        and forest ecosystem service provision are also growing, 
        with finance coming from public and private sources. 
        Ecosystem markets are developing and expanding to 
        channel these payments for environmental services—including
        markets for forest carbon, habitat protection and 
        restoration, and water provision.
        <br><br>

        Collectively, these global policy signals and growing 
        investments provide a positive foundation for continued 
        progress in enhancing the contribution of forest ecosystem
        services toward achievement of SDG 15. Existing international 
        guidance documents such as the UN Forest Instrument and the
        UN Strategic Plan for Forests provide a framework for 
        national actions and international cooperation to sustainably 
        manage forests, and should continue to be promoted as tools 
        to support countries' efforts at integrating forest ecosystem 
        services into all aspects of national policymaking and planning. 
        Ultimately, countries must establish regulations and incentives 
        which properly acknowledge and account for the values provided 
        by forest ecosystems to society, and which direct sufficient 
        finance to safeguard these services over the long-term for 
        sustainable development. While evidence suggests this is beginning
        to happen, continued leadership and bold action will be necessary
        to scale-up this progress in order to fully achieve the 2030 
        Development Agenda goals.
