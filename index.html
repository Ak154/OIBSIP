                    Nature is part of our life. We grew out of the seed, 
                    the earth, and we are part of all that, but we are 
                    rapidly losing the sense that we are animals like 
                    the others. Can you have a feeling for a tree, look
                    at it, see the beauty of it, listen to the sound it 
                    makes? Can you be sensitive to the little plant, a 
                    little weed, to that creeper growing up the wall, 
                    to the light on the leaves and the many shadows? 
                    One must be aware of all this and have that sense 
                    of communion with nature around you. You may live 
                    in a town, but you do have trees here and there. 
                    A flower in the next garden may be ill-kept, crowded 
                    with weeds, but look at it, feel that you are part 
                    of all that, part of all living things. If you hurt 
                    nature, you are hurting yourself.
